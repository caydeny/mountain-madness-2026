# 💸 RBC — Relative Budgeting Calendar

An AI-powered budgeting app that minimizes impulse spending and turns saving money into a daily game.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

RBC connects your **calendar** and **bank account** to create smart, adaptive daily spending limits.

Instead of fixed monthly budgets, RBC:

- Analyzes your past year of income and expenses  
- Calculates how much you *can* safely save  
- Lets you set a savings percentage per term (monthly / biweekly)  
- Converts your remaining budget into dynamic daily limits  

---

## 🤖 How It Works

### 1. Login & Connect
- Sync your calendar(s)
- Connect your bank

### 2. AI Budgeting
- LLM classifies income, mandatory, and variable spending
- Calculates maximum spending per term
- Splits that into daily limits based on:
  - Event density
  - Estimated event costs
  - Historical behavior

### 3. Daily Tracking
- Stay under your daily limit → earn a ✔
- Consecutive days → build streaks
- Unused limit → redistributed intelligently
- End of term → unused funds move to savings

---

## 🎯 Goals

Set savings goals (e.g., $800 TV).

Unused spending accumulates toward your goal via a progress bar.

When the goal is reached:
- You can purchase
- Your streak is protected

---

## 🏆 Gamification

- Daily streaks
- Friend leaderboards
- Rank system based on savings efficiency  

**Savings Efficiency = Saved ÷ Limit**

The more efficiently you save, the higher you rank.
